  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The Learning Management System used by my university is problematic in 2
    main ways: itâ€™s difficult to download course materials (too many clicks to
    get to the download pages, and you can only download individual files), and
    it looks very old (modern websites tend to favour cleaner designs). I was
    frustrated by these two pain points, so I made
    a chrome extension that allows for one-click recursive downloads of course
    materials, and makes the LMS look (objectively, in my opinion) better. More
  than 25% of the undergraduate population is currently using my unofficial extension. </p>
