  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The Learning Management System used by my university is problematic in 2
    main ways: itâ€™s difficult to download course materials (too many clicks to
    get to the download pages, and you can only download individual files), and
    it looks very old (modern websites tend to favour cleaner designs). I was
    frustrated by these two pain points, so I made
    a chrome extension that allows for one-click recursive downloads of course
    materials, and makes the LMS look (objectively, in my opinion) better.

  <h2>My Contribution</h2>
  <p>I developed the entire extension on my own, and self-initiated the
    project. It was pretty successful, in my opinion (over 20% of my
    university's undergraduates use it
    almost daily). It
  had neither had nor needed any official backing</p>

          <li>JavaScript (ES6) (for the collated download functionality)</li>
          <li>Chrome Extensions API</li>
          <li>Sass (to override the ugly default styling)</li>

  <h2>Software Challenge</h2>
  <p>The styling was simple. I just wanted a shift to a flatter, more
    minimalist design from the older, skeuomorphic-ish one. The main challenge was the recursive download
    functionality, which would download all files found in folders and
    all subsequent subfolders. I made AJAX requests to extract all relevant
    information from further pages, while maintaining the user's current page.
    Also, due to limitations imposed by the Chrome Extensions API, I had to
    resort to an event-based system to trigger each individual download.
