  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>An experimental project to help students better visualize 3D graphs (it
    takes some getting used to!). By mapping hand movements to movements which
    explore the graph, we hoped to make the abstract graph more physical and,
    for want of a better word, tangible. I didn't make the holographic display
    (I had great teammates who did that part),
    but the software, and interfacing with the Leap Motion hand tracker, was
    all done by me.
