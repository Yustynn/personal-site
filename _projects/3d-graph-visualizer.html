  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>An experimental project to help students better visualize 3D graphs (it
    takes some getting used to!). By mapping hand movements to movements which
    explore the graph, we hoped to make the abstract graph more physical and,
    for want of a better word, tangible.

  <h2>My Contribution</h2>
  <p>I made all the software, and also developed the interface (which
    hand controls mapped to which actions). </p>

  <h2>Software Challenge</h2>
  <p>I had no prior Unity, C# and Leap Motion experience. Unity in particular
    took a while for me to self-learn. Beyond that, the biggest challenge I
    faced was the procedural generation of the graph, and shading
    it just the way I wanted (with the tron-like effect). It took a while to
    learn how to set the triangles, and it was a very cool concept to learn.

  <h2>UX Challenge</h2>
  <p>The project relied heavily on good user experience. Interacting with the
    software using hands instead of a mouse and keyboard <strong>had</strong>
    to feel natural, or as close to natural as possible, because the project
    was about finding a way of making these 3D graphs feel more 
    intuitive.</p>
    
  <p>
    I tried endless different hand poses and gestures, as well as
    independently interviewed 10 different users and had them try out various
    hand controls to see which they preferred. It was a good lesson about
    balancing power (the ability to interact with the graph with what I thought
    of as expert-level speed) and ease of use. I'm still slightly unsatisfied
    with the compromise I chose, as it takes a few seconds to get the hang of
    the controls. But it was easy to use after the adjustment period, and,
    particularly due to time and resource constraints (done is better than
    chasing perfect), I stand by my choice.
