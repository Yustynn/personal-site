  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>A fun (seriously, go try it!) 2D platformer game, built from scratch in
    pretty much all JavaScript. It’s wrapped in a fullstack website (deployed on
    heroku). Chock-full of cool features, I made this project with 3 friends from
    Fullstack Academy over the course of 2 sleepless weeks. It was made a while
    back, but it’s still my favorite
    project to date.</p>

  <h2>My Contribution</h2>
  <p>I worked significantly on all parts. But the 'ghost' feature (playing
    against your old playthrough) was primarily mine. I overcame storage size and
    browser framerate syncing issues during the recording and playing back of
    different playthroughs, and managed to build the ghost player code without
  at all modifying the code controlling the main player.</p>

  <h2>Routes</h2>
  <p>One of the things I'm proudest of is making a declarative set of
    higher-order functions that made route creation for CRUD operations in
    Express+MongoDB easy, and often
    one easily understood line. I still use the code when I make a server with
    using that tech.</p>
  <pre>
    <code class='javascript'>
      router.post('/', mustBeLoggedIn, createDoc('Level','creator'));
    </code>

  <h2>Ghost Syncing Issues</h2>
  <p>Due to the variable rate at which browsers request animation frames, two
    playthroughs grow more and more out of sync as time passes. This is problematic as the main
    mechanism of moving the Ghost player is by playing back the recorded
    actions of the player's previous playthrough (which assumes the exact same
  framerate). A lack of synchronicity would lead to Ghost Gus improperly
  walking off edges or into spikes or missing rotations. It was horrible.
  </p>
  
  <p>In order to fix the syncing without taking up too much space per recorded
  playthrough, I took snapshots of the main player's coordinates and
  orientation in the game
  level at fixed intervals during the playthrough. I then forced the Ghost onto
  those coordinates with the proper orientation at those intervals during the
  playback. It took some experimentation to get the interval just right so that
  it wasn't too short (would take up excessive space), nor too long (there
  would be a noticeable 'jump' as the Ghost suddenly appears in a new spot),
  but in the end it worked really well.
