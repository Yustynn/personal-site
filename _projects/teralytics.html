  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Teralytics gave my 5-man team the challenge of figuring out what types of users (in terms of age,
    interest, etc) go to each of 1000s of different websites. we were given
    nothing
    more than a large dataset containing anonymized users and their browsing
    patterns. My team developed and implemented a multi-step process,
    performing many tasks such as pre-categorizing a subset of the websites by
  genre, web-scraping a bunch of the websites for more features, and
  developing machine learning models to help with further categorization. I
  worked on a lot of these parts and did most of the data wrangling, but the part I'm proudest of (which I did
  single-handedly) was developing a fairly robust multi-threaded web scraper
  that scraped thousands of websites within a half hour.</p>
